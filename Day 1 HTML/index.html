    <h1>Difference between div and span</h1>
    <p>Ans:
        The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The span tag is much like the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an inline element. <br> 
Example: Span:    I am a <span style="color: yellowgreen;">good</span> Boy. <br>
        <div> div :Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Non rerum recusandae voluptas harum sequi vel autem omnis porro, cumque rem.</div>
    </p>

    <h1>Difference between class and IDs</h1>  
    <p>Ans:
        A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
    Example: <pre>Id:
                      <element id= "id_name"> 

                            In css property:
                            #id_name{
                                css property

                            }

                    class: 
                      <element class="class_name">  

                            in css propert:
                            .class_name{
                                css property
                            }

    </pre>
